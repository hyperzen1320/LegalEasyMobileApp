//
// Android only draws that dot for a notification the system has actually
// posted, and only the OS can post one for an app that isn't running.
// So the in-app bell count, however accurate, could never do it: this is
// the only route there.
//
// Everything here degrades quietly. Expo Go can't get a project-scoped
// token, an emulator has no push service, and a user may decline the
// permission — in each case the app carries on with the in-app badges it
// always had and simply doesn't register an address.

// Foreground behaviour: still post the notification. Someone reading the
// Case Vault should see a Senior Desk message arrive, and posting is
// also what keeps the launcher dot in step with the tray.
