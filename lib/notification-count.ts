// Singleton subscribable for the bell badge count. Many components can
// observe the same count (home topbar, admin topbar, any future drawer
// item) without each running its own poll. When the last observer
// unmounts polling stops; when an observer re-mounts it resumes.
//
// AppState-aware: while the app is backgrounded we pause the timer so
// we don't burn battery on a number nobody can see. We also re-tick
// once on foreground so the badge is fresh by the time the bell is
// visible again.
//
// What this deliberately does NOT do:
//  - Push notifications. Those are PR-C work — the in-app bell is the
//    fallback when push isn't available (Expo Go, push-disabled, etc.).
//  - Per-tab counts. The number here is the pending delete-request
//    count only; chat unread + reminder due counts will join in their
//    own subscribables in PR-C.
